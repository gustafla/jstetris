# jstetris

jstetris is a hobby/study project to make a tetris clone in plain HTML5 and javascript.  

## Why?

I've never coded anything in javascript or any other web technology.  
And I've never coded a tetris clone.  
This is a personal learning experience.  

## Personal remarks after most of core functionality was finished

Wow. JavaScript sure was a challenge to take head-on.  
The prototype system, passing and assigning by reference,  
"fields" or "properties" or what ever they're called...  
Weak typing! I feel like I now understand a bit more of these  
meta-terms such as weak/strong typing.  
Overall this was a bit of an eye opener and required some rethinking  
of a couple of programming concepts I've gotten used to.
