jstetris is a hobby/study project to make a tetris clone in plain HTML5 and javascript.

## Why?

I've never coded anything in javascript or any other web technology.
And I've never coded a tetris clone.

## Personal remarks after most of core functionality was finished

JavaScript was a challenge to take head-on. The prototype system, passing and
assigning by reference, "fields" or "properties" or what ever they're called
and weak typing were new to me. I feel like I now understand a bit more of these
meta-terms such as weak/strong typing.

Overall this was a good learning experience and required some thinking.
